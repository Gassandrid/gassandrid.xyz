# Notable Resources for learning concepts of Artificial intelligence

Here is a compiled list of some online resources that can be used to learn the basics of AI for free. Most of these are video playlists, but some of these sources are reading materials.

## Stanford Online

Stanford online contains several AI courses on their YouTube channel for free, both on the general concepts of the subject, but also diving deeper into newer, more advanced models like LLM's and other language modelling architectures
