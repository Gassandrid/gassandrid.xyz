We will be evaluating double integrals as **iterated integrals**. We will explain why shortly, but first we will explain how iterated integrals work.

## Iterated Integrals Defintions

**An integral of the following form**

$$\int_{a}^b \int_{c}^d f(x,y)\ \color{red} dy\ \color{blue} dx $$

Means that we $\color{red}first$ integrate with respect to y ( holding x fixed ) from `c` to `d`, and $\color{blue}then$ integrate the result with respect to x from `a` to `b`

### However...

**An integral with this form**

$$\int_{c}^d \int_{a}^b \ f(x,y) \ \color{red} dx \ \color{blue} dy$$

Means something something a little similar, except that we integrate $\color{red}first$ with respect to `x`, and then $\color{blue}second$ with respect to `y`.

## Basic Example

$$\int _{0} ^ 3 \int_{1}^2 \ x^2 y \ dy \ dx = \int_{0}^3 \left[ \int_{1}^2 x^2y \ dy \right] \ dx$$

Integrate first with respect to `y`

$$= \int_{0}^3 \left[ \left. \frac{x^2y^2}{2} \right|_{y=1}^{y=2} \ \  \right] \ dx $$

FTC with `y=1, y=2`

$$= \int_{0}^3 \left( 2x^2 - \frac{1}{2} x^2 \right) dx$$

Simplify and integrate with respect to `x`

$$\int_{0}^3 \frac{3}{2} x^2 dx$$
$$= \left. \frac{1}{2}x^3 \right|_{0}^3 = \frac{27}{2}$$

Leaving us with our final answer $\frac{27}{2}$

## What if we reverse the order of Integration?

Instead of doing it how we just did, we will instead evaluate the inner integral $\color{red}\int_{0}^3 \ and \ x \  limits$, inside of the outer integral $\color{purple} \int_{1}^2 \ with \ the \ y$ limits.

$$\color{purple} \int_{1}^2 \color{red} \int_{0}^3 \ x^2y \ dx \ \color{purple} dy  \color{grey}= \int_{1}^2 \left[ \int_{0}^3 x^2y \ dx \right] \ dy$$
