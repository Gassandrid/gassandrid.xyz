# Zenith

## Definition

The **zenith** is the point in the sky that is directly above an observer. It represents the highest point in the celestial sphere that is perpendicular to the observer's position on the Earth.

## Etymology

The term comes from the Arabic phrase "samt al-ra’s" which means "path over the head."

## Key Concepts

- **Local Zenith**: The zenith for any observer is unique to their position on Earth.
- **Altitude**: The altitude of the zenith is always 90 degrees from the observer’s horizon.
- **Celestial Sphere**: The zenith is a key reference point in the celestial sphere, an imaginary sphere where celestial bodies are plotted.

## Contrast with Nadir

The **nadir** is the point that is directly opposite the zenith, lying beneath the observer.

## Observations

- When a celestial object, like the Sun, is near the zenith, its rays strike the Earth's surface more directly, which leads to shorter shadows and can contribute to higher temperatures.
- The zenith changes based on the observer’s location and time due to Earth's rotation and orbit.

## Related Terms

- **Horizon**: The apparent line that separates Earth from the sky.
- **Azimuth**: The angle between a celestial body and the north, measured along the horizon.

## Uses in Astronomy

The zenith is a crucial reference point for:

- **Observations**: Astronomical observations often involve calculating the distance of objects from the zenith.
- **Telescopic Alignment**: Some telescopes are set to point towards or track objects approaching zenith for optimal clarity.

## Additional Notes

- The zenith is typically used in local reference frames for precise navigation and astronomical calculations.
