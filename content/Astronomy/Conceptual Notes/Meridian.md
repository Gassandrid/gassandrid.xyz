# Meridian

## Definition

The **meridian** in astronomy is an imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the **celestial poles** and the **zenith** of a particular location on Earth. It effectively divides the sky into eastern and western halves.

## Key Concepts

- **Local Meridian**: This is the meridian specific to the observer’s location. It connects the north and south points on the horizon with the zenith directly overhead.
- **Celestial Meridian**: This meridian extends beyond the local horizon, intersecting with the celestial poles.

## Related Terms

- **Zenith**: The point directly above the observer, which the meridian passes through.
- **Celestial Equator**: The imaginary projection of Earth’s equator onto the celestial sphere, which crosses the meridian.
- **Transit**: A celestial object is said to be in transit when it crosses the local meridian.

## Importance in Astronomy

The meridian is a key reference point used for:

- **Timekeeping**: The moment when the Sun crosses the local meridian is known as **solar noon**, the highest point the Sun reaches in the sky for that day.
- **Telescope Alignment**: Many telescopes are designed to track celestial objects as they cross the meridian, since objects appear at their highest and clearest point in the sky at that moment.
- **Celestial Navigation**: Navigators use the meridian to determine their latitude by measuring the altitude of stars as they cross the meridian.

## Types of Meridian

- **Prime Meridian**: In geography, this is the meridian at 0° longitude, but in astronomy, it refers to the meridian of an observer's location.
- **Antimeridian**: The great circle opposite the meridian, crossing through the nadir instead of the zenith.

## Meridian Passage

When a celestial object (like the Sun or a star) crosses the meridian, it's called **meridian passage** or **meridional transit**. At this point, the object is at its highest altitude in the sky for that day or night.

## Additional Notes

- The **Upper Meridian** is the part of the meridian above the horizon (passing through the zenith).
- The **Lower Meridian** lies below the horizon, passing through the nadir.
