This exam will cover chapters1,2, and 5.  

### Key Concepts:  

1. What is a science? A scientific hypothesis? Theory? What is the place of  
astronomy in the sciences?  

2. What units do we use to measure mass, time, distance?  

3. What is the celestial sphere and how do the stars and sun relate to it?  

4. What are the effects of the Earth’s rotation, its revolution, and its tilt? This is  
really a very broad question, and it is the stuff that typically gives students the  
most trouble. Spend some time with it!  

5. Explain the phases of the moon and eclipses.  

6. How did the motions of the planets shape the history of astronomy?  

7. What is the nature of light? In what ways does it behave like a wave and in what  
ways does it behave like a particle? What are the important properties of light  
waves? Describe the electromagnetic spectrum. What kinds of things do we see  
when we pass light from an astronomical source through a prism? What kinds of  
information can we glean from these spectra?  

8. How do telescopes help us in astronomy?  
The above list is NOT meant to be exhaustive!

37. Doppler effect  
**the increase (or decrease) in the frequency of sound, light, or other waves as the source and observer move towards (or away from) each other**

38. redshift  
part of doppler
light from object moving away from us

39. blueshift  
part of doppler
light from object moving toward us

40. refraction  
	-  When light passes through a medium and changes direction due to a change in speed. This happens when light moves from one medium to another, such as from air to glass. The amount of refraction increases as the wavelength of light decreases.

41. reflection
	- When light bounces off a surface, redirecting it in a different direction. The angle at which light hits the surface is equal to the angle at which it reflects.

42. angular resolution  
	- ==the smallest angle at which two objects can be distinguished from each other==, and it's a key factor in image resolution.

43. twinkling  
	- caused by a phenomenon known as ==astronomical scintillation==, which is a result of the Earth's atmosphere bending and distorting light from stars
	
67. light pollution  
	- the result of ==excessive or inappropriate artificial light at night==, which can negatively impact the environment and human health.
	
1. adaptive optics  
	- a technique that removes the atmospheric disturbance and allows a telescope to achieve diffraction-limited imaging from the ground
	
2. interferometry
	- **a measurement method using the phenomenon of interference of waves** (usually light, radio or sound waves).
