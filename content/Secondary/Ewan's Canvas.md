## Inspirations

`r/place circa 2022`

I was inspired by [r\/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) and fell in love with the idea of a shared art project among friends and strangers. 

And while I imagine there was a lot of interesting technology behind scaling such a simple concept to millions of people, I also felt like I could not make my own mark as easily given how competitive it ended up becoming.

## Implementations

Drunk on a Friday night, I have the completely original idea to reimplement this canvas on a smaller scale. And, with a good load of help from AI tooling(which I really needed that Friday), I made a simple HTML clone, using a Firebase DB hosted on GitHub Pages.

This has a few security concerns, mostly that anyone can go and hijack my database and delete everything, but frankly I was too drunk to care, and still don't really.
