## About
Undergraduate student at the University of Vermont studying Computer Science.

I consider myself a generalist who wants to explore every field of computer science, with a particular interest in AI/ML, Embedded Engineering, and Mathematics.

In my free time, I enjoy sailing in the Bay Area, working on personal projects, and documenting my life through Obsidian notes.
