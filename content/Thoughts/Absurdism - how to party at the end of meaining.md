Absurdism, founded by [[Albert Camau]], dictates that we should accept the absurd situation that we as humans are in, that being:

> Humanity is doomed to seek purpose in a world that has none to offer

In other words, in the great vastness that is the Universe, there is no grand meaning that we can find, which is what philosophies like Nihilism offer to us. But the problem with Nihilism and other philosophies is that, despite the reality that there is no meaning, we as humans still desperately seek to find one, an **absurd** situation to face.

## Isn't that what existentialism is all about?

Absurdism and existentialism both explore the human quest for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe, but they diverge in their conclusions. Existentialism, particularly in the works of philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre, emphasizes that individuals must create their own meaning and values through personal choice and action, despite the lack of inherent meaning in the universe. Absurdism, as articulated by Albert Camus, suggests that while humans naturally seek meaning, the universe offers none, leading to an inherent conflict or absurdity. Instead of resolving this tension by creating meaning (as existentialists suggest), absurdism advocates for embracing the absurd and continuing to live without resolving the contradiction.
