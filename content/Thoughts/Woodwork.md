I do a little bit of woodwork from time to time, and find it to be quite an enjoyable activity. Since I am in University now, I can't do proper woodwork with tools more complicated that a Chisel, but usually my [Leatherman](https://www.leatherman.com/charge-tti-832537.html) is enough for me to have a good time with it.

## Why I do Woodwork

My grandfather is by far the most skilled carpenter in my family, as he has done it for decades upon decades for his profession as a boat maker. 

My father, growing up under this environment, learned from the best, and coming from South Africa to Colombia, I can't imagine what else he would do for his free time!

But because of this, I was lucky to grow up with a family that taught me these things when I was young. Sure, I had my fair share of cuts and injuries, but I have come out able to easily work with carpentry heavy equipment and make all sorts of things for my personal projects.

But the reason I really like woodworking is the calming portion of the experience. There is nothing more stress relieving than going to sit outside in the park, pick up a stick, and spend an hour or two shaving away at it until you get something you are happy with. The process of making slow, methodical cuts is honestly more enjoyable than any result you come up with at the end, but a cool art piece is always a nice bonus!
