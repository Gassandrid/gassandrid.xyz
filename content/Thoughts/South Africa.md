Most of my family comes from South Africa, as my parents(despite only meeting in the United States) are both from there!

While South Africa is a beautiful country, it has definitely been struggling with its issues recently.

For one; [[Loadshedding]]. This problem started several decades ago when the South African government developed the power line network extensively, but didn't scale up the power generation infrastructure needed to support such a network. And because of that indecision to scale decades ago, South Africa to this day is still facing a worsening powergrid, with much of the country without power for a good chunk of the day.
