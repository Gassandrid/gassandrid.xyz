Navigating this garden can be a bit difficult if you are just relying on the links between notes or my poor choice of directory organization, so here is a sort of markdown "map" to help find what you are looking for!

## Notes and such

Mostly from college classes, but I do a lot of independent study for things like AI and general computer science concepts

### Calculus 3

You can check out #math for most of the notes, a more thought out organizer is coming!

### Statistics for Engineering

Like Calc 3, you can go to #statistics , but I also made an [[Statistics Index|organizer]]
